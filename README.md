Collection of my dotfiles.

These dotfiles are intended to run with xterm, zsh, vim

For everything to run properly, clone this into $HOME/.dotfiles
Dont forget to init/update the submodules

For xterm to work with the DejaVu fonts, copy `DejaVu Sans Mono for Powerline` and the bold version $HOME/.fonts
Then run `fc-cache -fv` to update the font cache.
